# 🚴‍♂️🏃‍♀️🥾 Strava Data Wizardry 🧙‍♂️📊

## Welcome to the Fitness Data Wonderland! 🎉

Ever wondered what your Strava data would say if it could talk? Well, grab your towel and your water bottle, because we're about to find out! This project is all about turning those sweaty GPX and TCX files into cool insights. It's like a fitness fortune teller, but with more Python and less crystal ball.

## What's Cooking? 🍳

- **Data Source**: Strava (because where else do you humble-brag about your KOMs?)
- **Secret Weapon**: Amazfit Fitness Tracker (it's watching you... in a good way!)
- **File Formats**: GPX and TCX (sounds like dinosaurs, works like magic)

## Features (or "What This Bad Boy Can Do") 🚀

- Turns your messy Strava files into a beautiful data buffet
- Figures out if you were cycling, running, or just vigorously napping
- Calculates how far you went, how long it took, and how fast you were zooming
- Makes pretty pictures that will make your high school math teacher proud

## What You'll Need 🧰

- Python 3.x (snake charming skills optional)
- Some fancy libraries: pandas (not the bear), matplotlib (for plotting, not world domination), seaborn (no actual sea or horn required)

To get these libraries, just whisper this incantation into your command line:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Work This Magic 🎩✨

1. Dump all your Strava files in one folder (yes, just dump them, it's very technical)
2. Wave your wand (or just run this command):
   ```
   python DataExtractor.ipynb
   ```
3. For the grand finale, run:
   ```
   python SmallAnalysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Voila! Check out the console for some cool stats and look for the PNG files (they're like photos, but nerdier)

## What You Get 🎁

- `distance_by_activity.png`: See how far you've gone (probably to the fridge and back)
- `speed_by_activity.png`: Find out if you're more cheetah or sloth
- `activity_frequency.png`: Proof that you do, in fact, exercise sometimes
- `heart_rate_by_activity.png`: Your heart's little diary (if available)
- `hourly_activity.png`: When you prefer to torture... err, exercise yourself

## Future Dreams 💭

- Add weather data (to justify why you didn't go out)
- Analyze your favorite routes (aka: where all the good snack stops are)
- Track your progress over time (from couch potato to slightly fitter couch potato)

## Privacy Stuff (Boring But Important) 🕵️‍♂️

This project is for your eyes only (unless you're into sharing your fitness journey). Make sure to keep any sensitive info to yourself. We don't want the whole world knowing about that time you got lost and accidentally ran a marathon.

## High Fives 🙌

- Strava, for making us feel bad about ourselves in a good way
- Amazfit, for the fancy arm candy that judges our lifestyle choices

Now go forth and analyze! May your distances be long, your speeds be high, and your excuses for skipping leg day be creative. Happy data crunching! 💪📈
